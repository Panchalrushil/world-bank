Work/Life Balance
<br>The WBG makes an effort to help staff achieve balance in their work and personal lives.

The Bank strives to offer flexible work arrangements to provide a better work/life balance for staff. Some of the programs that are offered include telecommuting, alternate and reduced work schedules, flextime, job sharing and home-based work. These arrangements are based on the discretion of the hiring manager, the business needs of the institution, and the specifics of each individual.
<br><br>
In addition, the Bank headquarters offers other services to assist in achieving work/life balance:
<br><br>
Health Services Department: An on-site Health Services Department provides consultation and treatment for minor ailments or injuries during the work day and clinical services related to work assignments (such as pre-employment evaluations and travel medicine), as well as preventive care services. The department has a Health Promotion Program offering a wide range of ongoing programs and scheduled activities to encourage good health habits for staff and families.
<br><br>
Fitness Center: The Bank’s fitness center is fully supplied with state-of-the-art exercise equipment, locker rooms, showers, saunas, and exercise studios to promote and maintain the good health, morale, and productivity of staff.
<br><br>
Child Care: The World Bank Group recognizes that for many staff quality child care is a high priority. Our Children’s Center provides high quality services in this area. In addition, backup child care is available to staff members who need emergency or temporary child care.
<br><br>
Lactation Room: Rooms for nursing mothers are available in a number of World Bank Group offices.
